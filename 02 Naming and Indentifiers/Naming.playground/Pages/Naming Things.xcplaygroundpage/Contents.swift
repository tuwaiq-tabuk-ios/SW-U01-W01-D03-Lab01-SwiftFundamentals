//: ## Naming Things
//: In programming, names can be very descriptive and useful, helping you keep track of what’s what — just like the names you give things in real life. In code, when you give a value a name, you can use that name everywhere you would use the value. This makes the code easier to read and understand.
//:
//: Names also help you avoid errors in your code. For example, it was easy to make a mistake in the pet show experiment, since you had to change a number in multiple lines of code for each update. But if you’d defined a name for each value (for example, the number of turtles), you would only need to change the definition of the name once and the updated definition would be used everywhere the name appears in your code.
//:
//: In Swift, you can choose a name and associate it with a value by defining a _constant_. You’ll explore constants in more detail later in the course. For now, it’s enough to know that constants are a fundamental way of naming values in Swift.
//:
//: Use the word `let` followed by a name to define a constant and the equal sign `=` to give a value to the constant:
let numberOfDogs = 6

let numberOfCats = 5

let numberOfTurtles = 2

let numberOfHamsters = 1

//: After you’ve defined a constant and assigned a value to it, you can use the constant wherever you would have used the value, including in mathematical calculations that define the value of a new constant:

let totalNumberOfAnimals = numberOfDogs + numberOfCats + numberOfTurtles + numberOfHamsters

let totalNumberOfMammals = numberOfDogs + numberOfCats + numberOfHamsters

let numberOfDogs2 = 6 + 2

let numberOfCats2 = 5 - 1

let numberOfTurtles2 = 2 + 1

let numberOfHamsters2 = 1 + 1
