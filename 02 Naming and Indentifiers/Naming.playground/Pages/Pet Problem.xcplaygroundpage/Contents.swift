//: ## Pet Problem
//: Imagine your friend is putting together a pet show and needs to keep track of how many animals of each kind will be in the show.
//: Your friend also needs to know how many total animals and how many mammals will be at the show.
//:
//: Now imagine that all you have with you is a laptop with Xcode on it. Maybe you can use a playground to help your friend.
//:
//: Using what you know so far, you could keep track of the count for each animal using a comment and a number, like this:
// Number Of Dogs
5

// Number Of Cats
4

// Numer Of Turtles
3
//: Then you could copy those numbers onto new lines of code and let the playground do some math for you, like this:
// Total Number Of Animals
5 + 4 + 3

// Total Number Of Mammals
5 + 4

// number of dogs
6

// number of cats
5

// number of snaks
2

// number of turtels
3

// total number of animals
6 + 3 + 2 + 3
// total number of mammals
6 + 5
