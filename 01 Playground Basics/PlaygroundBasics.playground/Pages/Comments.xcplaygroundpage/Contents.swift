//: ## Comments
//: Programmers leave little notes right in the code to help explain it.
//: This helps people understand the code when they read it later.
//: These notes are called _comments_.
//:
//: Comments are ignored by the playground and do not affect how your code is run.
//: 
//: A comment starts with two slashes `//` :
// This is a comment; it does not affect the code
34 + 56 + 230  // This is the sum of a number
//: Because comments are ignored, no result is displayed in the results bar for that line of code.
 200 + 34 + 45

//This is the sum of a number
